Summary: Review of progress toward my personal goals from 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-15.
Status: published


# Goals
* **Relationships:** I spent 80% of my nights socializing with people. I caught up with a lot of friends from college and had several nice dates.
* **Career:** The Lansing JVM User Group's back on! We had a low key meeting at Reno's East which I consider a pretty great success. And I've finally written a post on BDD with ScalaTest, which I'll develop into a slide deck soon.
* **Health and Longevity:** I've finally gotten around to fixing up bikes for the riding season.
* **Financial Independence:** We finally moved our emergency fund to a bank with higher interest.

# Habits
## Leave Work on Time
This has been going better. The minor task list did help fill the time between 3:00pm and 4:30pm with light commitments.

### Habit
* Trigger(s): Computer and phone reminders at 3:30pm, computer and phone reminders at 4:00pm, computer and phone reminders and auto-close computer communication apps at 4:30pm, auto-logout at 5:00pm.
* Action(s): Stop current task. Close email and chat applications. Work on an easy task.

## Personal Goals Reviews
Still going strong. I'm gonna remove this habit from future posts, as it's pretty well established.

## Tech Blagging
This has been going well as well. I wrote [Behavior Driven Development on the JVM with ScalaTest]({filename}/blog/behavior-driven-development-on-the-jvm-with-scalatest.md) last week. I'm going to stop mentioning this in the future as well, as it's well established.

## Bedtime Routine
I finished [Idoru](https://amzn.to/2HNBe4x) and picked [The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman](https://amzn.to/2FPfi86) back up. This habit is becoming a bit hit or miss though. I'll keep an eye on it.

## Financial Reviews
We missed this fortnight's financial review. :/


# Projects
## Behavior Driven Development on the JVM + BitClock Scala
I finished [Behavior Driven Development on the JVM with ScalaTest]({filename}/blog/behavior-driven-development-on-the-jvm-with-scalatest.md) and started [bitclock-scala](https://github.com/lucidmachine/bitclock-scala/). There's still a bit of functionality left to be implemented, and I'd like to turn the blog post into a presentation, but I'm well pleased to have finally gotten this out of my head.

## Hardware Bitclock
I've created a repository for [bitclock-j5](https://github.com/lucidmachine/bitclock-j5) and committed tooling and a testbed. Next I'll try controlling the Arduino Uno's onboard LED with TypeScript and get to soldering that LED matrix.
