# Notes
* Part I: Resistance
    * Resistance is the enemy.
    * Resistance is proportional to the importance of a task.
    * We rationalize our Resistance in order to reduce cognitive dissonance.
* Part 2: Professionalism
    * The Professional makes overcoming Resistance to their calling their full-time job. "To the amateur, the game is his avocation. To the pro it's his vocation."
    * Qualities of the Professional:
        * Show up every day.
        * Show up no matter what.
        * Stay on the job all day.
        * Commit long-term.
        * Make the stakes real.
        * Get paid.
        * Don't over-identify with the job.
        * Master the techniques of the job.
        * Have a sense of humor about the job.
        * Receive praise and blame in the real world.
    * Separate your Professional consciousness from your personal ego.
    * Recognize your limitations and recruit others to help.
* Part 3: The Higher Realm
