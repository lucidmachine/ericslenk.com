Summary: Review of progress toward my personal goals from 2019-04-29 to 2019-05-13.
Status: published


# Goals
* **Relationships:** This fortnight I got to know some new friends quite a bit better and reconnected with some old friends as well. I'm quite pleased.
* **Career:** I'm still working through [Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano](https://amzn.to/2DCGd4v), and I hosted another JVM User Group. That's two months in a row now.
* **Health and Longevity:** Still not much progress. At least I've picked up work on my bikes again.
* **Financial Independence:** Not much to report here.

# Habits
## Leave Work on Time
I've collected the following data:

|       Date | Leave Time  | Reason(s)                                                       |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

| 2019-04-30 | 05:42:00 PM |                                                                 |
| 2019-05-01 | 05:20:00 PM |                                                                 |
| 2019-05-02 | 06:00:00 PM |                                                                 |
| 2019-05-03 | 04:40:00 PM |                                                                 |
|            |             |                                                                 |
| 2019-05-06 | 06:25:00 PM | I stayed late to finish an atomic unit of work                  |
| 2019-05-07 | 06:40:00 PM | Kept doing easy “one more thing” tasks                          |
| 2019-05-08 | 06:27:00 PM | Troubleshooting machine issue w/ helpdesk, prototyping redesign |
| 2019-05-09 |             | Waited for JVM User Group at office                             |
| 2019-05-10 | 05:35:00 PM | Waiting for integration test results                            |
|            |             |                                                                 |
|    Average | 05:52:07 PM |                                                                 |

I can immediately see that I'm leaving the office about 1 hour later than I intend to leave. I began recording *why* I thought I was leaving late during week 2, so I don't have much data here, but it seems that I'm failing to leave because I crave some sense of resolution or the ego boost of an easy win. I'll collect more data this fortnight and give some thought to course of action.

### Habit
* **Trigger(s): Computer and phone reminders at 4:00pm, computer and phone reminders and auto-close computer communication apps at 4:30pm, auto-logout at 5:00pm. Record leave time and the reason I left when I did.**
* Action(s): Stop current task. Close email and chat applications. Work on an easy task.

I didn't do nearly as well collecting this data, and it's less instructive. I'll try again this coming fortnight. The meager time data I do have suggests I'm not too far from my target of 10:00pm, though.

### Habit
* Trigger(s): Dinner.
* **Action(s): Quit current activity. Pack clothes, books, and laptop for
 the next day. Brush teeth. Make a mug of tea. Log bedtime and the reason I went to bed when I did in journal. Read book in bed. Go to sleep.**

## Financial Reviews
We missed last week's financial review. We were still at a friend's house during our regularly scheduled thing and didn't think of it when we got home. I'm going to try incorporating this review into my personal goals review, as it's a better established, more ingrained, more rewarding habit at this point.

**Trigger(s): Personal Goals Review.**
Action(s): Update transaction log in Mint. Obtain high-level overview.

# Projects
## Hardware BitClock
I finished attaching the components of the LED matrix and wrote about its design in [Hardware BitClock: Part 1]({filename}/blog/hardware-bitclock-part-1.md). Next week I'll attach the thing to a microcontroller and control it by software. I've also ordered a real-time clock module and might start experimenting with it.
