## Prerequisites
1. Install your handlebars.
1. Install your brake levers.
1. Install your shift cable housing.
1. Optionally, install your brake cable housing.
1. Begin wrapping your bar tape, at least a couple turns. This is important
   because the shifters **also function as your bar tape plugs**, and going back
   to install this later will require you to uninstall things.


## Shifters
- For each shifter:
  1. Insert the plug assembly into the bar-end.
    * Ensure the plug secures the bar tape.
    * Ensure the bar tape doesn't obstruct the hole through which the shift
      cable will be pulled.
  1. Tighten the plug assembly by turning the hex bolt in its center
     **counter-clockwise**. This is a little counter-intuitive, so consider
     doing it outside of the bar-end a couple times for understanding.
  1. Slide the rectangular post through the hole in the plug assembly.
  1. There should be a ring which sites between the plug assembly and the lever
     assembly. It will have a square indent on the plug assembly side, and a
     ring indent on the lever assembly side. There should be notches on each
     side which ensure there is only 1 correct orientation for its installation.
     Put it on and don't fuck up.
  1. Add the lever assembly. Again, there should be 1 correct orientation to
     interface with the ring. Don't fuck up.
  1. Tighten the torque bolt into the lever assembly until the lever assembly
     can no longer pivot.
  1. Loosen the torque bolt by about 180 degrees, or until the lever assembly
     can once again pivot.
  1. If your rear derailleur shifter has an indexed mode, then set it to indexed
     mode and loosen the torque bolt until you can shift into each position.


## Afterward
1. Finish your bar tape.
1. Install your shift cables.
