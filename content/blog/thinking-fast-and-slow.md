# Notes
* Two systems. Sys. 1 is automatic and intuitive. Sys. 2 is effortful, req. concentration.
    * Sys1 generates the feelings and beliefs about which Sys2 reasons. Sys1 -> Sys2.
* "Switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time presure."
* People who are more **cognitively busy** are more likely to give in to temptations to behave badly, etc.
* **ego depletion** - If you force yourself to do something, you are less likely to exert self control when the next challenge comes around.
    * ego depletion != cognitive busyness
* Exerting **mental energy** spends **blood glucose** - Bauchmeister et. al.
* **Truth illusion** - **Improving cognitive ease** makes info feel more familiar, and is therefore **remembered as truthful**.
    * Methods for improving cognitive ease:
        * Bigger, bolder, more legible font
        * High contrast colors
        * Short words
        * Rhyming
        * Easily pronounceable names
* Cognitive strain engages Sys2.
* **Anchoring effect** - When one considers one value before estimating a second, unknown value, the estimate will be near the first value.
    * Ex. - "normal" price @ $1,000 makes "sale" price @ $400 seem low.
* Psych student's **don't change beliefs** when confronted **with stats**, but **do** when confronted **with stories** that surprise them.
* "Subjects' unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular."
