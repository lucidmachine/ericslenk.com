# Current Process
Presently, I think I learn like this.

1. Topics come randomly from media streams.
    * RSS
        * Blogs
        * Hacker News
    * Reddit
1. Topics percolate in my head for a while.
1. When I have an abundance of free time, then I'll seek some learning material like a book or a tutorial on whatever's at the forefront of my mind.

This workflow has several negative consequences:

* My knowledge is broad, but hardly any of that knowledge is deep. 
* There is no strategy to *what* I learn, so that knowledge is of dubious value.
* I don't consistently learn new things.
* I don't reinforce the knowledge I have gained.
* I don't build deeper knowledge on the knowledge I have gained.

# Preferred Process
1. Topics come from:
    1. Periodic introspection: What do I need to learn to do or do better?
    1. Curated media streams.
1. Topics are catalogued and prioritized somewhere.
1. Periodically search the catalogue for a topic to reinforce, expand, or learn anew.
1. Periodically maintain the catalogue. Prioritize and trim topics.
