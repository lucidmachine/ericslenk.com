Summary: Review of progress toward my personal goals from 2019-03-18 to 2019-04-01.
Status: published 


# Goals
* **Relationships:** I've had some good date nights this fortnight. I also met plenty of people while volunteering with this month's [Lansing JavaScript Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-Javascript-Meetup/)! I haven't seen much of my friends lately but I have plans in the works with many of them.
* **Career:** I learned a few things about [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) at the JavaScript meetup. I've also begun working through the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) machine learning MOOC [Practical Deep Learning for Coders v3](https://course.fast.ai/), which has lit my goddamn brain on fire.
* **Health and Longevity:** I've been exercising my knee and it seems stronger. Plus, I've been getting outside and walking now that Spring has sprung! I'm working on getting several bikes in riding shape for the season as well!
* **Financial Independence:** TAXES.

# Habits
## Leave Work on Time
This is still going poorly. I keep telling my co-workers to get out while they can, too, but I'm still personally uncomfortable leaving at 3:30pm, and even a bit uncomfortable leaving at 4:00pm, so I try to find something low-effort to work on until 4:30pm or 5pm? But that doesn't seem to pan out for me. I think I need to deal with this discomfort directly, but I'm not quite sure how.

As a secondary measure, I might also try to identify tasks which *are* ideal for taking up 30-45 minutes of my time without causing me to stay past 5pm, and to switch to that task list at 3:30pm. Off the top of my head:

* Fill out work log.
* Write tomorrow's task list.
* Work through triage queue.

### Updated Habit
* Trigger(s): Computer and phone reminders at 3:30pm, computer and phone reminders at 4:00pm, computer and phone reminders and auto-close computer communication apps at 4:30pm, auto-logout at 5:00pm.
* Action(s): Stop current task. Close email and chat applications. **Work on an easy task.** GTFO.

## Personal Goals Reviews
Yeah, this is *much* nicer than publishing on Friday evening.

## Tech Blagging
Yeah, that was *much* nicer than publishing every weekend. I wrote [Publishing a Pelican Site With CircleCI]({filename}/blog/publishing-a-pelican-site-withcircle-ci.md).

## Bedtime Routine
I'm back on my mint tea bullshit and finishing up [Idoru](https://amzn.to/2HNBe4x). I love Gibson's treatment of the virtual Walled City and nodal points.

## Financial Reviews
This past review was fairly successful as well. Much less stressful now.


# Projects
## Easier Blog Publication
I accomplished this! See: [Publishing a Pelican Site With CircleCI]({filename}/blog/publishing-a-pelican-site-withcircle-ci.md). I now have the ability to build and preview my blog in The Cloud (Other People's Computers)! And there's a weekly publication job. I may add more capabilities over time like checking spelling and links or publishing the post on Twitter but I'm pretty happy with this, and I've built some skills using CircleCI.

## Behavior Driven Development on the JVM + Java/Scala Bitclock
The JVM User Group sorely needs some content and I've been looking for a better testing framework at work, so I'm going to try out a few Behavior Driven Development test frameworks on the JVM and write an article and a talk about it. Of course, I'll need something to test for demonstration purposes, so of course, I'm gonna write *another* Bitclock implementation.

## Hardware Bitclock
Rescheduled. I'm gonna have to get back to this after the BDD thing.
