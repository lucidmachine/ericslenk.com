Summary: Review of progress toward my personal goals from 2019-08-05 to 2019-08-19.
Status: published


# Goals
* **Relationships:** I've made it out to a few social events this fortnight, including a Lansing Lugnuts game with the Lansing Codes crew!
* **Career:** The JVM User Group's picking back up! We had a pretty good turnout at our last meeting. I'm sinking a bit more time and effort in to marketing and promoting to grow the community.
* **Health and Longevity:** I've had a couple appointments with my family physician, some lab work, and a couple counseling sessions. And I've squeezed in a few long bike rides!
* **Financial Independence:** We've reigned in our spending a pretty good amount this month!


# Habits
## Leave Work on Time
This is still going really well. Just a couple slip ups due to actual emergencies at work. Soon I'll need to find a different reward which doesn't involve so much sugar.

### Habit
* Cue: Computer and phone reminders and auto-close computer communication apps at 4:30pm, auto-logout at 5:00pm.
* Response: Stop current task. Log work for the day and set tomorrow's agenda. Pack up and walk out that damn door.
* Reward: If I've left on time, grab a snack from the snack bar on my way out. Bask in all that free time I've clawed back to enjoy life.

## Bedtime Routine
I'm still reading [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution) and I've switched to peach iced tea. This has gone really well as well.

### Habit
* Cue: Dinner's finished.
* Response: Pack for the next day. Brush my teeth. Grab a tasty beverage. Read in bed. Go to sleep.
* Reward: Read a fun book and drink a tasty beverage.

## Financial Reviews
This was a lot less stressful with transactions split out. And we've got a pretty good amount socked away for car shopping!

* Cue: Personal Goals Review.
* Response: Log in to Mint. Review budgets and goals.
* Reward: Goal fund goes up and to the right.

## Transaction Updating 
This has gone super smoothly as well! I shifted to updating transactions first thing in the morning, before I read the news or check Twitter or whatever. "Rewarding" myself with having to get up and go make coffee turned out not great as it's *all the way over there* and doesn't allow for me to lay around reading feeds or napping.

* Cue: Pick up my phone for the first time in the day.
* Response: Open the Mint app. Rectify any transactions which have arrived since yesterday morning.
* Reward: Idle reading / nap.

# Projects
## Update Primary Care Physician
This appointment went really well! I've had lab work done since and have a follow up physical exam and a physical therapy consultation scheduled.
