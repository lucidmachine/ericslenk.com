Summary: Review of progress toward my personal goals from 2019-04-15 to 2019-04-29.
Status: published


# Goals
* **Relationships:** I didn't spend much time with people this fortnight.
* **Career:** I'm slowly and steadily working my way through [Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). It's been quite informative thus far, and the exercises are pretty fun puzzles.
* **Health and Longevity:** Not much to speak of here.
* **Financial Independence:** We finally moved our emergency fund to a higher-interest account!

# Habits
## Leave Work on Time
This is going okay, but I stayed late a couple nights this past fortnight because our team's behind track and I wanted to notch some easy wins. Maybe I need to learn how to better cope with failure? In the interim I'm going to try doing away with the 3:30pm alarm since it always seems too far out to take seriously.

### Habit
* **Trigger(s): Computer and phone reminders at 4:00pm, computer and phone reminders and auto-close computer communication apps at 4:30pm, auto-logout at 5:00pm.**
* Action(s): Stop current task. Close email and chat applications. Work on an easy task.

## Bedtime Routine
I'm going to try recording my bedtimes for this fortnight. I'm still working through [The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things).

### Habit
* Trigger(s): Dinner.
* **Action(s): Quit current activity. Pack clothes, books, and laptop for
 the next day. Brush teeth. Make a mug of tea. Log bedtime in journal. Read book in bed. Go to sleep.**

## Financial Reviews
Back on track!


# Projects
## Hardware BitClock
I successfully ran the [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) hello world analogue on my Arduino and got to play around a bit with [the REPL](http://johnny-five.io/examples/repl/)! Now I'm most of the way through assembling the LED matrix. I've improved my understanding of transistors quite a bit, too! I'm hoping to have this ready for next Monday's post.
