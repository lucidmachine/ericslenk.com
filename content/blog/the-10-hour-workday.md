Summary: Reflections on the virtues and pitfalls of a 10 hour workday.
Status: draft

* Pros
    * More focused
        * Take on long tasks, as I can dedicate 5-6 hours and still have enough productive time for my next task
        * Completing a task in 1 sitting rather than 2 means I don't have to spend time reacquainting myself with a task on day 2
    * Free Friday
        * Personal projects
        * Hobbies
        * Chores
        * All of these things with morning energy instead of in the evening after I'm exhausted
* Cons
    * Hungry :(
        * Bad for diet
    * Short evenings at home
    * Stay up late, may ruin next day
