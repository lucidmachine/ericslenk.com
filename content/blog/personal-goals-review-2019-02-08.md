Summary: Review of progress toward my personal goals for 2019-01-25 to 2019-02-08.
Status: published 


# Goals
* Relationships: I spent some time with some people, which was nice. But perhaps not enough time, which isn't.
* Career: I learned a lot of valuable skills this fortnight. I also had considerable success in dealing with some tough situations at work. And I've received some pretty favorable reviews!
* Health and Longevity: What the heck is my shoulder doing? I should probably actually see a doctor soon.
* Financial Independence: We started talking about and handling our debt emergency, which was good. But we stopped working on it actively after like a week, which was bad.

## Personal Goals Reviews
I opened this review at the start of the fortnight and occasionally updated it with notable events throughout the fortnight. This experiment had two goals: 1) determine whether I can reduce the amount of time writing these reviews and 2) get a more accurate, holistic snapshot of the whole fortnight rather than a Friday-centric, fuzzy memory. Naturally, I totally forgot to open it for the rest of the fortnight. At least the reminder worked.

## Bedtime Routine
I've reliably performed the whole ritual each night this fortnight. I'm still enjoying the tea and [The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things). I've also begun to reread [Virtual Light by William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Light). It turns out that The Design of Everyday Things is the sort of book about which I'm inclined to take notes, and taking notes is not at all conducive to going to sleep. I think using "after dinner" was an effective trigger, though I note that I haven't eaten dinner at a consistent time this week.

## Leave Work on Time
Barring a few work emergencies I've continued to enjoy leaving work at reasonable times.

# Projects

## Bitclock

I [modularized Bitclock using Webpack]({filename}/blog/modularize-your-javascript-with-es6-modules-and-webpack.md) and then [converted Bitclock from JavaScript to TypeScript]({filename}/blog/converting-to-typescript-toolchain.md) this fortnight. The exercise taught me plenty about modern frontend tooling and gave me a bit more experience in TypeScript! I'm pretty excited about TypeScript's type system - especially Interfaces and union types. And I even got to leverage a bit of this knowledge at work throughout the week.
