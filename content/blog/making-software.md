# Notes
* There are too few good, generalizable studies in Software Engineering.
* May need studies to provide "tiers" of observations:
    * Context/ audience-specific observations
    * General, regorous observations
* Test Driven Development:
    * Makes **no difference** when measuring the **internal quality** metrics such as complexity.
    * Makes **small improvements** to **external quality**.
    * Has a high learning curve.
* Code **coverage** is **very weakly** related to quality.
* Code **churn** is **highly related** to **defects**.
* | Metric          | Precision | Recall |
  | --------------- | ---------:| ------:|
  | Org. Structure  | 86.2%     | 84.0%  |
  | Code Complexity | 78.6%     | 79.9%  |
  | Code Churn      | 79.3%     | 66.0%  |
  | Social Network  | 76.9%     | 70.5%  |
  | Dependencies    | 74.4%     | 69.9%  |
  | Code Coverage   | 83.8%     | 54.5%  |
