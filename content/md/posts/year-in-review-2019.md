2019 has been a trip. I definitely did a lot of things, but I'm not that much closer to my goals than I was in 2018. My personal relationships aren't stronger on the whole. My career's progressing, but it's taken some unexpected turns, and a lot of the direct action I've taken was for naught. My health has generally improved as I'm in less pain and I've been eating better. My finances are worse.

# Things That Went Well
* I developed self-reflection habits.
* I started going to therapy.
* I worked with a physical therapist to alleviate the pain in my shoulder.
* I've improved my cooking skills by learning a new recipe each week.
* I got promoted and took on more leadership responsibilities at work.
* I built a bunch of software BitClocks which were instructive.
* I built a couple mechanical keyboards.

# Things That Didn't Go Well
* I overextended and burned myself out in the fall.
* We bought a car on a loan when we should have saved for a house.
* The JVM User Group died under my organization.
* I built a hardware BitClock which... I'm not really happy with.
* I never quite cemented good bedtime habits.

# Things To Do In 2020
* Reduce toil.
* Focus on goals more than once every two weeks.
* Reduce hard commitments.
