 :description "How I learn, and how I think I should learn instead."}


# Current Process
Currently, I think I learn like this:

1. Topics show up randomly randomly from various media. These include blogs I follow, social media sites like Reddit, wherever.
1. Those topics just sort of float around in my head for a while.
1. When I have too much free time, then I might go find a tutorial on whatever's at the forefront of my mind.

This sucks because:

* I have a breadth of useless knowledge with little depth.
* There is no strategy to *what* I learn, so that knowledge is of dubious value.
* I don't consistently learn.
* I don't reinforce knowledge I have gained.

# Desired Process
I think a workflow like this would be better:

1. Topics come from:
    1. Periodic introspection: What do I need to learn to do or do better?
    1. Curated media streams.
1. Topics are catalogued and prioritized somewhere.
1. Periodically search the catalogue for a topic to reinforce, expand, or learn.
1. Periodically prioritize and prune the catalogue.

My hypothesis is that:

* The knowledge I acquire would more practically suit me.
* My knowledge retention would improve.
* I might develop advantageous expertise.

This workflow would require the following habits:

* **When** I recognize that I'm spending more than a minute or so learning about a topic, **then** I should quickly add it to the catalogue and move on.
* **When** a day or more has elapsed, **then** I should spend at least 15 minutes learning about my current topic.
* **When** I complete a topic, **then** I should mark it as complete in the catalog and de-prioritize it.
* **When** a week or more has elapsed, **then** I should prioritize the catalog.
* **When** I am just sick of my current topic, **then** I should cycle it back into the catalog and de-prioritize it heavily.
