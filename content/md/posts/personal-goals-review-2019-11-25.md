Well it has been a *HOT MINUTE*. I totally burned myself out. I'm doing better now that I've scaled back a lot of commitments.

# Goals
* **Relationships:** I've fallen out of touch with a lot of people.
* **Career:** Cross-training's been picking up nicely. I'm preparing to grow into a Scrum Master role, but still trying to figure out what that actuallymeans.
* **Health and Longevity:** I've fallen out of practice with my shoulder exercises. And since the snow's fallen and my winter bike's not roadworthy I haven't been riding.
* **Financial Independence:** Oof.


# Habits

## Shoulder Exercise
Fell off enough that my shoulder's occasionally uncomfortable again.
### Habit
* Cue: Walk past the office gym on my way to lunch.
* Response: Grab a cup of coffee and exercise my shoulder.
* Reward: Coffee during the workout.

## Cooking Skill
Oh hey. I'm actually still crushing this. I've been cooking most nights of the week, bringing lunches every workday, and learning a new recipe or two each week.
### Habit
* Cue: Meal planning.
* Response: Scour the Internet for a new recipe. Write up its salient details. Print it out.
* Reward: Eat a small dark chocolate bar.

## Bedtime Routine
This old trope. It was one of my more beneficial habits while I was at it, so I'm gonna rebuild it. I'm reading [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7284452M/Flow) and drinking chai tea.
### Habit
* Cue: Dinner's finished.
* Response: Pack for the next day. Brush my teeth. Grab a tasty beverage. Read in bed. Go to sleep.
* Reward: Read a fun book and drink a tasty beverage.

# Projects

## Car Shopping
We bought a dang car. It's fully spreadsheet compliant, and my wife's pretty happy with it.

## House Search
This has been called off. After some radical rearranging we have enough space to work with in our current residence.

## Personal Web Development Stack
Absolutely no progress since I last wrote. I'm gonna table this while my creative energy's rebounding.
