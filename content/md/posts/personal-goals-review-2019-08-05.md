# Goals
* **Relationships:** I got to catch up with family a couple times this fortnight. And I've been working on holding boundaries and vulnerability in my interpersonal relationships.
* **Career:** I've officially been promoted to SE2! I'm putting more effort into marketing the [Lansing JVM User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-JVM-User-Group/) in order to ramp up for the fall. [Next meetup's Thursday, August 8](https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-JVM-User-Group/events/bvdvfryzlblb/)! And I exercised some Clojure skills by building [a program to convert the JDK Enhancement Proposal index into an RSS feed](https://github.com/lucidmachine/jep-feed).
* **Health and Longevity:** I've got a checkup scheduled for the 9th! I'm seeking a personal therapist as well, though only 1 in 10 has called me back so far.
* **Financial Independence:** We've made progress in our car hunt by establishing what the hell our budget is and a rubric for evaluating candidate cars. This has alleviated a lot of my anxiety.


# Habits
## Leave Work on Time
This has gone flawlessly since I last wrote. Seems too easy, to be honest.

I believe simplifying my cues was a good idea. I'm less sure whether rewarding myself with a snack for leaving before 5pm has been effective or is good overall, but there have been a couple afternoons where I left specifically to get the snack so I'm gonna keep it for now.

As for the fundamental model, I'm piecing together a role model for somebody who leaves the office before 5pm. It's been helpful to notice that a lot of the people I look up to at work are leaving between 4:30pm and 5:00pm as well.

### Habit
* Cue: Computer and phone reminders and auto-close computer communication apps at 4:30pm, auto-logout at 5:00pm.
* Response: Stop current task. Log work for the day and set tomorrow's agenda. Pack up and walk out that damn door.
* Reward: If I've left on time, grab a snack from the snack bar on my way out. Bask in all that free time I've clawed back to enjoy life.

## Bedtime Routine
I've been reading [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution) and drinking mint iced tea. Switching to lighter reading material before bed was definitely helpful.

### Habit
* Cue: Dinner's finished.
* Response: Pack for the next day. Brush my teeth. Grab a tasty beverage. Read in bed. Go to sleep.
* Reward: Read a fun book and drink a tasty beverage.

## Financial Reviews
I'm spinning transaction fixing into a separate habit to make this easier and less punishing. To make this more rewarding I'm going to focus on positive impacts. I've got a goals fund account set up and I'm going to wrap up each session by looking at its increase.

* Cue: Personal Goals Review.
* Response: Log in to Mint. Review budgets and goals.
* Reward: Goal fund goes up and to the right.

## Transaction Updating 
I'm going to try updating my Mint transactions on a daily basis. If I do this frequently enough I'll be able to review my financial situations with ease while minimizing the pain of upkeep. If I do this in small batches I can manage my transactions from my phone, so I'm going to try doing this while I idly paw at my phone before I get up.

* Cue: Run out of content in my Twitter feed in the morning.
* Response: Open the Mint app. Rectify any transactions which have arrived since yesterday morning.
* Reward: Coffee.

# Projects
## Hardware BitClock
Still to movement because I still don't really want to do this any more. I'm gonna call it good enough, do a brief write-up, and try to move on.

## Iris Mechanical Keyboards
I'm still trying to find the time to learn to desolder the microcontrollers with hot air. Until then this project's on hold.

## Update Primary Care Physician
I've got an appointment scheduled! Now I've just got to show up.
