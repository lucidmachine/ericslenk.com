# Goals
* **Relationships:** I've spent plenty of time with loved ones this fortnight.
* **Career:* I'm grateful for all the trust put in me at work.
* **Health and Longevity:** I've gotten back into my 
* **Financial Independence:** Well 3 out of 4's not bad.


# Habits

## Shoulder Exercise
I've gotten back into my exercises. My shoulder feels much better again.
### Habit
* Cue: Walk past the office gym on my way to lunch.
* Response: Grab a cup of coffee and exercise my shoulder.
* Reward: Coffee during the workout.

## Cooking Skill
I've kept up with the new recipes each week. I haven't cooked as much this fortnight, though. I really went overboard right before Thanksgiving, so we've been coasting on leftovers for more than a week now.
### Habit
* Cue: Meal planning.
* Response: Scour the Internet for a new recipe. Write up its salient details. Print it out.
* Reward: Eat a small dark chocolate bar.

## Bedtime Routine
This one's still not going so well.
### Habit
* Cue: Dinner's finished.
* Response: Pack for the next day. Brush my teeth. Grab a tasty beverage. Read in bed. Go to sleep.
* Reward: Read a fun book and drink a tasty beverage.

## Journaling
I've begun writing a brief journal entry each night. It helps me reflect on how my week or fortnight's been. I might yet roll this habit into my "Bedtime Routine" habit's Response once it's properly re-established. I'm concerned that I don't have a proper reward for this one. As near as I can tell it's sort of been the joy of using my newly configured text editor? That doesn't seem sustainable in the long run though.
### Habit
* Cue: Sit on the bed at the end of the day.
* Response: Open my journal. Record a few sentences about my day.
* Reward: ???


# Projects

## Personal Web Development Stack
I've done a lot of reading on full-stack web development stacks again. I'll take some time before year's end to test out a couple of stacks.

## dotfiles
I've been investing time in my dev machine configuration and publishing that configuration in [my dotfiles repo on Github](https://github.com/lucidmachine/dotfiles). And I've switched my editor from Spacemacs to NeoVim. This may not be the most productive thing I could be doing, but I've sure been having a lot of fun with it.
