## [redirtest](https://gitlab.msu.edu/canr/redirtest)

redirtest is a simple redirect testing utility. Given a file containing input and expected final URLs, it will tell you whether visiting the input URL sent the client to the expected final URL and trace all of the intermediate redirects. This is extremely useful for defining and refactoring redirects, and the definition document is very handy for communicating about those redirects to boot!
